## A goal without a plan is just a wish.
####    ― Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

To expand on that, a plan which doesn't use widely demonstarted tools, is also just a wish.
My goal is simple, Show you the dream and exactly how to get there. 

* I hold these truths to be self evident
    + People who have power, sought power and generally want more
    + People who have money, sought money and generally want more
    + People who have fame, sought fame and generally want more
    + If someone gains power, fame, or money by making my life better, my life is still better


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
